A **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web tool designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it visually demonstrates algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort in real-time. Users can select an algorithm, adjust the array size, and control the sorting speed to see how data is sorted step by step. The clean interface and dynamic animations make it a great learning resource for students and anyone curious about algorithmic processes.
